## SNAKE GAME

Day 2 of Python learning, decided to learn by making some simple games. This is just the snake game that was on the Nokia 20 years ago. I'm ready to have some fun!

Was just in the comments section of the YT tutorial I'm following for this... one guy hit the nail on the head: It's not so much a tutorial as it is a "watch me code this." Lol...

It's a good first project though. So what if I need to google a bunch of stuff?!

Will finish on day 3 of Python. üêç‚ú®
